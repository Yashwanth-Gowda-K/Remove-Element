This repository contains a clean and well-commented Python solution to the LeetCode problem **[27. Remove Element]
## 🧠 Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in-place and return the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

## 🔍 Example
```python
Input: nums = [3, 2, 2, 3], val = 3  
Output: 2
